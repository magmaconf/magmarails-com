        its large and bustling port and beautiful beaches. Known as the “Sailfish Capital of
        the World”, the city is popular for its deep-sea fishing and temperate waters. The De
        Santiago peninsula, where MagmaConf and Magma Village are located, is a well-known
        tourist destination with excellent swimming, snorkeling and scuba diving available.
        <br/><br/> Manzanillo is also home to the twin bays, almost identical in length. Bahia
